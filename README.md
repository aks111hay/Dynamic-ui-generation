# Dynamic UI Generator with Gemini

This project is a Flask-based web application that dynamically generates user interfaces using Google's Gemini Pro model. The application takes a user's natural language prompt and generates HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a UI component on the fly.

## Features

*   **Dynamic UI Generation:** Leverages the Gemini Pro model to create UI components from natural language prompts.
*   **Flask Backend:** A simple and lightweight web server to handle user requests and serve the application.
*   **Real-time Interaction:** Users can type in what they want to see, and the UI is generated and displayed instantly.
*   **Easy to Customize:** The system prompt for the Gemini model can be easily modified to change the style and behavior of the generated UI.
